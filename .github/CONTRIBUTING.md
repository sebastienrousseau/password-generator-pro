### Code Contributions

Contributing code is one of the more difficult ways to contribute to the
Password Generator Pro.

#### Feature Requests

Filing feature requests is one of the most popular ways to contribute to the
the Password Generator Pro.

Is there some feature request that you'd like to code up yourself? Is there a
feature you asked for yourself that you'd like to code?

Here's how to contribute code for a new feature to the Password Generator Pro.
Pull Requests allow you to share your own code with us, and we can merge it into
the main repo.

#### Adding Code

- Fork the repo.
- Clone the the Password Generator Pro repo by running: `git clone https://github.com/sebastienrousseau/password-generator-pro.git`
- Install Node.js and PnPm if you haven't already, and run `pnpm install`. This
  installs the required dependencies for building the the Password Generator
  Pro.
- Edit files in the `src/` folder. Don't edit any files in the `dist/` folder,
this is only for distribution builds, which are automated.
- Run `npm run build` to trigger builds, and the new distribution files will
be in the `dist/` folder ready to go.
